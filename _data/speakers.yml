    I used to work as a programmer, but I eventually gave up because I couldn't find a job, and ended I trying to make a living selling fantasy novels. Maybe this last fact shows that I'm not a great programmer (though there might be other factors in play). I love Rust because it makes me feel more confident about the code I write, and the strict compiler compensates for my lack of discipline.

    Igor is studying Computer Science at the University of Warsaw, Poland. Having worked on a AAA game and various smaller ones, he grew tired of the repetitiveness of the process and started a journey to find a language that would aid in building better abstractions. He discovered Rust and decided to help further the IDE story, so the development process would be more enjoyable. He was accepted onto the Google Summer of Code 2017 as a student and has been working to improve the RLS and IDE support.
