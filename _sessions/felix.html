  Is Rust doomed to stagnate under the yoke of stability guarantees? Is
  change an inevitable force that will invalidate all your existing
  code? Is there a reasonable medium between these extremes? We explore
  these questions, under the guise of a modern day fable.

  Felix "Scrooge" Klock remembers the early days when Rust development
  was fast and loose, an untamed beast. As a result, today he fears
  changes to the language definition.

  Gather round as this "Scrooge" is visited by a series of spirits
  (manifesting themselves as Rust crates), including:

  * The Ghost of Rust Epochs Past (code circa the 1.0 release),
  * The Ghost of Rust Epochs Present (code today), and
  * The Ghost of Rust Epochs Yet To Come (code as envisaged by the host
  of RFC's as we head into the 2017 impl Period).
