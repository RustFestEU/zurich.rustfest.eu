title: Networking & Web
desc: >
  In this workshop we hold an open space for those attendees interested in the web or networking to come, share what they’ve been working on, ask for advice, or learn about new techniques. There is no set content or agenda, we’ll start the day by gathering a list of topics, and throughout the day anyone who wants to will have a chance to speak to them.

  If you’re interested in Tokio, Hyper, distributed systems, Gotham, Rocket, interacting with databases, or if you’re interested in trying out speaking in a small group, this workshop might be a good choice for you.
