title: IoT Workshop for Microcontroller and Embedded Linux Systems
desc: >
  This workshop will be a hands-on training for developing bare-metal and embedded Linux systems using Rust. You will use Tock-OS to create a low power Bluetooth sensor node on a Hail development board, and build a Smart IoT Gateway using a Raspberry Pi 3.

  Training and hardware will be provided for developing Rust software on both Microcontroller and Embedded Linux based systems. Attendees will start with a working base example for both devices, and can build new functionality from there. Some experience with Rust and either (or both) Microcontroller or Linux systems is recommended.
