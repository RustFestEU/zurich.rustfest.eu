title: Rust in the browser with WebAssembly
desc: >
  In this workshop you will learn the basics of why and how would you compile Rust to WebAssembly, set yourself up with the environment to do so and learn how to build a library that can interact with JavaScript. We will look at the advantages of not using the Rust standard library and other ways to reduce the size of the WASM bytecode as well as sending arbitrary data between JavaScript and compiled-to- WASM Rust.
