Immediately following the conference, on October 2nd and 3rd, we're currently planning a nice get together with some folks from the community as well as the Rust Team.

You can find us on Monday and Tuesday here at
<pre><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/70730651" target="_blank">
    Quartierhaus Kreis 5
    Sihlquai 115
    8005 Zürich
</a></pre>
owned by <a href="http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/quartierhaus5">the city of Zürich</a>. As you can see there is a small kitchen we'll be able to use as well as some leisure and lounge space.

<p>
The topic of the get together will be to work on topics related to the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/09/18/impl-future-for-rust.html"><tt>impl</tt> period</a>. It will be a great chance for you to work on things with your newfound (or old) friends. It will be "bring your own food" (or just go out for lunch), and while there will be some content organized by the Rust Team members present, most things will be ad-hoc. We're hoping to get somewhere in the ballpark of 40 people involved.
